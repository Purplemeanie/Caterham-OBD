[English|Basic Engine Setup]
Information = 
1D_ENGINEANDTRIGGERWHEEL, Engine and Trigger Wheel, Engine and Trigger Wheel, Defines the arrangement and number of cylinders on the engine and the type of trigger wheel fitted to the engine. Any changes here will only take effect after the power has been cycled on the ECU.
1D_TRIGGERWHEELEDGES, Trigger Wheel Edges, Trigger Wheel Edges, Select Active Crank Sensor Edge at ECU Pin. Most trigger wheel configurations will use Falling Edge at ECU Pin. MBE have historically  used Rising Edge at ECU Pin for GM (Opel Vauxhall) 60-2.  Falling Edge at ECU Pin (Improved Crank cct) must be used for 24-2 and 12+1. Note. Falling Edge at ECU Pin (Improved Crank cct) has better noise suppression. But if the trigger wheel or sensor has damage the cct is likely to highlight a fault better. e.g. during cranking or at lower RPM than would be seen normally.
1D_GOTOSEQIGNWHENSYNCHED_2, Wasted Spark or Coil on Plug, Wasted Spark or Coil on Plug, If Type is set to 'Coil on Plug (Sequential) with Cam Sensor' the engine must have a Cam Sensor. The ECU will switch to sequential ignition when cam sensor is synchronised; If engine will not start or stops instantly; Unplug cam sensor; if engine then starts ok the cam sensor is synchronised incorrectly; Go to 'Cam Sensor Setup' and adjust the Cam Phase Offset or  Hall Effect Tooth depending on setup; No Cam Sensor required for Wasted Spark mode;
1D_USERENGINEOFFSET, Crank Sensor Position Offset, Crank Sensor Position Offset, Crank Sensor Position Offset determines the position of the Ignition and Fuel with repect to the Crank Sensor and (Primary) Missing tooth Angular Position (A Larger Number Advances the Ignition and Fuel). The reference tooth is the last tooth before the (primary) missing tooth/teeth. It should be set such that with the Engine stationary at TDC. Measure the Angle between the reference tooth and the Crank Sensor (in the direction of engine rotation).  Note that you can set the Crank Sensor Position Offset to any angle between -360 and +360degs. If the CAM edge occurs in the expansion or exhaust stroke of Cylinder#1 then you must set the Crank Sensor Position Offset between 0 and +360degs. If the CAM edge occurs in the intake or compression of Cylinder#1 then you must set the Crank Sensor Position Offset between 0 and -360degs.            Example values for I4: Rising Edge: 60-2 VX 228 Deg. 60-2 Peugeot 219 Deg. Falling Edge: 60-2 VW 82 Deg. 36-1 Ford 2.0L Duratec 263 Deg. 24-1 Busa  227 Deg. 24-2 Busa 211 Deg. Rover K 33 Deg. 24-1 Busa V8 (V-72) 120 Deg; (V-108) 48 Deg.
1D_CRANKINGIGNITIONADVANCE, Cranking Ignition Advance, Cranking Ignition Advance, Cranking Ignition Advance. If the engine is turning at a speed less than the <Crank Exit Speed> (i.e. Cranking); the ignition angle is derived only from the <Cranking Ignition advance>. Sample values for I4:60-2 VX +8 Deg. 60-2 VW +8 Deg. 36-1 Ford +8 Deg. 24-1 Busa 0 Deg. 24-2 Busa 0 Deg. Rover K +10Deg.
1D_ONLYDOWASTEDSPARKIFNOCAM, Spark Strategy (VTwin Only), Spark Strategy (VTwin Only), If enabled this feature allows the engine to run wasted spark if no cam sensor is fitted or to run one spark per cycle if the cam signal is good. The cam sensor is only checked above the crank exit speed hence the engine will always crank in wasted spark mode., DISABLED
RT_SPARKSTRATEGY, Spark Strategy, Spark Strategy, Shows whether the ECU is currently firing one spark per cycle or one sprak per rev. This is only applicable to engine code F., DISABLED
1D_CRANKEXITSPEED, Crank Exit Speed, Crank Exit Speed, The threshold at which the ECU changes from Cranking Maps to Running maps. Once the engine speed is above this number the ECU will not go back into cranking until the speed goes below the Crank Entry Speed. If the number is not in the range 350 -> 1000 rpm; the ECU will use a default of 650 rpm
1D_CRANKENTRYSPEED, Crank Entry Speed, Crank Entry Speed, The threshold at which the ECU changes from Running maps to Cranking Maps. If the Engine speed is below this number the ECU will remain in cranking mode until the speed exceeds the Crank Exit Speed. If the number is not in the range 350 -> 1000 rpm; the ECU will use the Crank Exit Speed.
1D_WHENIGNISSWITCHEDOFF, When Ign is Switched Off, When Ign is Switched Off, If the ECU has a permanent supply on pin 10; when the ignition (pin 13) is turned off this determines what happens. After an initial 10 seconds the ECU can go to sleep; wait for the rad fans/water pump too cool the engine and go to sleep or go to sleep after a period of time. The time being set by <Max Power Hold Time>
1D_USERMAXPOWERHOLDTIME, Max Power Hold Time, Max Power Hold Time, Max Power Hold Time. This is the maximum length of time that the ECU will remain awake for after the ignition has been turned off. See <When Ign is Switched Off> for details
1D_INJECTORTYPE(ETOH), Injector Type (E to H), Injector Type (E to H), Injector Type (E to H), DISABLED
1D_FUELEVERYREV_STRATEGY, Fuel Every Rev Strategy, Fuel Every Rev Strategy, Must be set to 'Disabled' for only sequential Fuel. Set to 'When Not Synched' for grouped fuel when cam sensor is not synchronised. Set to 'Always' to run fuel every rev no matter the sync status. Fuel each rev may be benificial to some engines helping them to rev up from low speed.
1D_FUELEACHCYCLE_THRESHOLD, Fuel Each Cycle Threshold, Fuel Each Cycle Threshold, Fuel Each Cycle Threshold. If Fuel Every Rev is enabled then the engine will always run Fuel Each Cycle above this threshold. This overrules the Fuel Every Rev Strategy 'Always'. At higher injector duty cycles time is lost if the injectors are opened each rev; by only opening each cycle better control of the fuel is achieved.
1D_USERINJABANK, Inj/Ign A location, Inj/Ign A location, Inj/Ign A location. This selects the Bank that injector A and ignition A are associated with.
1D_USERINJBBANK, Inj/Ign B location, Inj/Ign B location, Inj/Ign B location. This selects the Bank that injector B and ignition B are associated with.

1D_USERINJDBANK, Inj/Ign D location, Inj/Ign D location, Inj/Ign D location. This selects the Bank that injector D and ignition D are associated with.
1D_ENABLETRMISSTDETECTINCRANKING, Enable Tooth Ratio Missing Tooth Detect In Cranking, Enable Tooth Ratio Missing Tooth Detect In Cranking, Enable Tooth Ratio Missing Tooth Detect In Cranking. Only for use on 4 or 8 cyl engines. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This is for use with high compression engines that are having trouble starting. It can be used in conjunction with the extended time base; if the engine is also turning over slowly. If either this or the extended time base are selected then the ECU may retard the ignition from the <Cranking Ignition Advance>; to try to avoid the engine kicking back. As engines requiring this feature are liable to kick back; we recommend increasing the torque of the starter motor but you may USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
1D_ENABLEEXTENDEDCRANKINGTIMEBASE, Enable Extended Time Base In Cranking, Enable Extended Time Base In Cranking, Enable Extended Time Base In Cranking. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This is for use with engines that crank very slowly and connot be made to crank faster by other means. It can be used in conjunction with Tooth Ratio Missing Tooth Detect if the engine is also varying its speed within a revolution. If either this or the Tooth Ratio are selected then the ECU may retard the ignition from the <Cranking Ignition Advance> to try to avoid the engine kicking back. As engines requiring this feature are liable to kick back; we recommend increasing the cranking speed of the engine but you may USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

1D_CAM1WINDOWOPENANGLE, Cam 1 Window Open (Angle), Cam 1 Window Open (Angle), Cam 1 Window Open (Angle). Unless you are having problems with the cam input the cam window options should all be set to their maximums. If the engine will start and run but has problems once the engine synchronises to the cam then you may be able to use the cam window to fix the problem. For small single tooth and half moon cam wheels; record the <Measured Cam 1 Phase> with the engine runing whilst the engine is not synched. Subtract 60 from the Cam 1 phase and enter it into the <Cam 1 Window Open (Angle)> (if below zero add 360). Then put 80 in <Cam 1 Window Length (Angle)>, DISABLED
1D_CAM1WINDOWLENGTHANGLE, Cam 1 Window Length (Angle), Cam 1 Window Length (Angle), Cam 1 Window Length (Angle). Unless you are having problems with the cam input the cam window options should all be set to their maximums. If the engine will start and run but has problems once the engine synchronises to the cam then you may be able to use the cam window to fix the problem. For small single tooth and half moon cam wheels; record the <Measured Cam 1 Phase> with the engine runing whilst the engine is not synched. Subtract 60 from the Cam 1 phase and enter it into the <Cam 1 Window Open (Angle)> (if below zero add 360). Then put 80 in <Cam 1 Window Length (Angle)>, DISABLED
1D_ENABLESTARTWITHCAM, Enable Start With CAM, Enable Start With CAM, Enable Start With CAM. ONLY FOR SINGLE TOOTH CAM SYSTEMS. Using this feature may help high compression engines or slow cranking engines to start. The Cam angle for this feature must be corectly set up before it is enabled; failure to do this may result in damage to the engine.
1D_CAMCRANTRESETANGLE, Cam Angle for Start With CAM, Cam Angle for Start With CAM, Cam Angle for Start With CAM. ONLY FOR SINGLE TOOTH CAM SYSTEMS. This is the angle of the cam in degrees after TDC of the first cylinder to fire. If you start the engine without this feature then "Measured CAM 1 Phase" will give a very good aproximation of this the value needed (see note). Using this feature may help high compression engines or slow cranking engines to start. NOTE: A suggestion is to use "Measured CAM Phase 1" and subtract a number of degrees based on the number of teeth on the Crank Trigger wheel. For a 24 tooth crank wheel subtract 7; for 36 subtract 5 and for a 60 subtract 3.
RT_SUGGESTEDCRANKTOOTHTOCHECKCAM, Suggested Crank Tooth To Check Cam, Suggested Crank Tooth To Check Cam, Suggested Crank Tooth To Check Cam. If Sync Unsing Cam on Crank Tooth is selected then the ECU will attempt to find the best crank tooth to use and display the tooth number here. You can then enter this as the <Crank Tooth To Check Cam> to enable the engine to sync.

[English|Launch & Traction Control|Traction Control]
Information = We use Rev Limiter based traction control which can be setup for Percentages of Slip; or Speed Difference or a combination of both.  You effectively program a Target Slip or Speed value for a Soft Rev Limiter & then a higher value for the Hard Rev Limiter.  Once the Soft Rev Limiter is reached  the ECU than randomly cuts single sparks to regain control of traction. If traction is regained and the Slip or Speed drop below the minimum thresholds. Then the Traction Control ceases to operate. If further grip is lost and traction continues further into the Soft Limiter towards the Hard Limiter the ECU will take away more sparks in order to regain Traction. If the Hard Limiter is reach all sparks will be removed. Note. The Launch button will disable Traction Control while the button is depressed to allow tyre warming or practice starts.

[English|Launch & Traction Control|Traction Control]
Information = We use Rev Limiter based traction control which can be setup for Percentages of Slip; or Speed Difference or a combination of both.  You effectively program a Target Slip or Speed value for a Soft Rev Limiter & then a higher value for the Hard Rev Limiter.  Once the Soft Rev Limiter is reached  the ECU than randomly cuts single sparks to regain control of traction. If traction is regained and the Slip or Speed drop below the minimum thresholds. Then the Traction Control ceases to operate. If further grip is lost and traction continues further into the Soft Limiter towards the Hard Limiter the ECU will take away more sparks in order to regain Traction. If the Hard Limiter is reach all sparks will be removed. Note. The Launch button will disable Traction Control while the button is depressed to allow tyre warming or practice starts.

[English|Launch & Traction Control|Traction Control]
Information = We use Rev Limiter based traction control which can be setup for Percentages of Slip; or Speed Difference or a combination of both.  You effectively program a Target Slip or Speed value for a Soft Rev Limiter & then a higher value for the Hard Rev Limiter.  Once the Soft Rev Limiter is reached  the ECU than randomly cuts single sparks to regain control of traction. If traction is regained and the Slip or Speed drop below the minimum thresholds. Then the Traction Control ceases to operate. If further grip is lost and traction continues further into the Soft Limiter towards the Hard Limiter the ECU will take away more sparks in order to regain Traction. If the Hard Limiter is reach all sparks will be removed. Note. The Launch button will disable Traction Control while the button is depressed to allow tyre warming or practice starts.
